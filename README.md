# Reliably initialize `Meteor.settings`

This package provides a `MeteorSettings` object with only one function: `setDefaults`. This function works on the client or server.

## Installation:
```
meteor add ogourment:settings
```

## Provide sensible defaults

Call `MeteorSettings.setDefaults(defaultSettings)` to populate the `Meteor.settings` object with sensible defaults for your app. If you do this in all the source files where you access `Meteor.settings`, this will ensure your app does not crash when accessing a setting, or avoid duplicating the code that checks if the settings are not empty.

Example:
```
MeteorSettings.setDefaults({
  public: {
    book: { title: "My Story" }
  }
});
```

## Alert the user when they forgot to provide settings

Sometimes, there are no sensible defaults. In that case, you want to alert the developer when he forgot to provide a `settings.json` file. This usually only makes sense on the server. In this case, pass `MeteorSettings.REQUIRED` as the second argument. A Meteor.Error will be thrown and the server will crash (nicely).

Example:
```
// I can provide a title for you, but not an author or anything else!
MeteorSettings.setDefaults({
  public: {
    book: { title: "My Story" }
  }
}, MeteorSettings.REQUIRED);
```

## Troubleshooting

1. Make sure to read the [official doc on Meteor.settings](http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/meteor_settings). Note: only `public` settings are passed to the client, and *only* those which were in the initial `settings.json` file (**Not** the ones passed as defaults- unfortunately).
1. A [detailed example](https://github.com/ogourment/settings/commit/36f120980b091e923a94708c084d05cae79c23b7) is provided.
1. Look at the [tests](https://github.com/ogourment/settings/blob/master/src/settings_tests.js) to see what is supported.
